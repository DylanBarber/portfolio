      Below you can download my resume which outlines my 3 years experience in the IT field ranging from the beginning at help desk, to network
      engineering, and ending up currently in software engineering. I have been almost entirely self taught through my career and have an optimistic progressive
      attitude at self development that helps me learn new technology concepts everyday to better my work. I currently work at Road to Hire in Detroit, MI where
      I utilize my knowledge in JS and various frameworks to create web apps and API's to support their data.
